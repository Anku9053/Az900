## WHat isCloud Computing??ðŸ¤”
Cloud computing ek aisi technology hai jisme computing services, jaise ki virtual machines, storage, databases, aur networking, internet ke through provide kiye jaate hain. Isme traditional IT infrastructure ke elements ko bhi shaamil kiya jata hai. Cloud services aaj kal Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), aur artificial intelligence (AI) jaise advanced technologies ko bhi include karte hain.

Iska matlab hai ki users ko apne local devices par necessary hardware aur software setup nahi karna padta, balki wo services ko remotely access kar sakte hain. Cloud computing ki madad se, users ko scalable aur flexible computing resources milte hain jinhe woh apne requirements ke hisab se use kar sakte hain, aur unhe sirf utni hi resources ke liye pay karna padta hai jitni unhe zarurat hoti hai.

Yeh approach cost-effective hota hai kyunki users ko apne infrastructure ko upgrade ya maintain karne ke liye kharcha nahi karna padta, aur unhe on-demand access milta hai advanced technologies jaise ki AI aur ML ka istemaal karne ke liye. Is tarah se, cloud computing ek modern aur efficient tareeka hai IT resources manage karne ka.


## SMall Benefits of cloud computing ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“
cloud computing ka upayog karke, users ko khud apne infrastructure ko upgrade ya maintain karne ke liye kharcha nahi karna padta. Traditional IT infrastructure mein, jab aapko apne servers, storage, aur networking equipment ko upgrade ya maintain karna hota hai, to isme considerable cost aur time lagta hai.

Cloud computing mein, aap third-party service providers ke through computing resources ka upayog karte hain. Iska matlab hai ki aapko khud servers kharidne ya maintain karne ki zarurat nahi hoti. Aap sirf woh resources use karte hain jo aapko zarurat hote hain, aur iske liye aapko provider ko pay karna hota hai.

Isse cost-effective hota hai kyunki aap only us amount ke liye pay karte hain jo aapne use kiya hai, aur aapko apne infrastructure ki scaling aur maintenance ki chinta nahi hoti. On-demand access ke karan, aap quickly aur flexibly advanced technologies jaise AI aur ML ka istemal kar sakte hain jab aapko zarurat ho.

Overall, cloud computing ek modern, efficient, aur cost-effective approach hai IT resources manage karne ka, jo traditional methods ke mukable mei adhik flexibility aur scalability provide karta hai.

## Terms In Cloud Computing DefinationðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨
##Internet of Things (IoT):
Jab devices, jaise ki sensors aur smart gadgets, data generate karte hain aur ye data cloud computing ke through manage hota hai. Isse data ko ek central location se control kiya ja sakta hai aur ye system scalable hota hai, matlab ki aap as per requirement apne data ko badha ya ghataya ja sakte hain.

##Machine Learning (ML):
Cloud services aise computational power aur resources provide karte hain jo machine learning models ko train karne aur deploy karne ke liye zaroori hote hain. Isse organizations ko apne infrastructure ko upgrade karne ki zarurat nahi hoti, aur wo machine learning ka faida utha sakte hain bina kisi bade infrastructure ke.

##Artificial Intelligence (AI): 
Cloud computing AI applications ke development aur deployment ko support karta hai. Ye computational resources, storage, aur tools provide karta hai jo AI ko seamlessly business processes aur services mein integrate karne mein madad karte hain.

## History Of Cloud ðŸ¥±ðŸ¥±
Client/Server Computing: Before the emergence of cloud computing, there was client/server computing, where all software applications, data, and controls were centralized on the server. Users had to connect to the server to access specific data or run programs.

Distributed Computing: Following client/server computing, distributed computing came into play. In this model, computers were networked together and shared resources as needed.

Concept of Cloud Computing: Based on distributed computing, the concept of cloud computing emerged. The idea was to implement computing resources in a way that resembles a utility, much like water or electricity.

John McCarthy's Suggestion (1961): In 1961, John McCarthy suggested in a speech at MIT that computing could be sold as a utility. However, despite interest in the idea, the technology was not ready for it at that time.

Salesforce.com (1999): In 1999, Salesforce.com started delivering applications to users over the Internet, making the idea of computing as a utility a reality for enterprises.

Amazon Web Services (AWS, 2002): In 2002, Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), providing services such as storage, computation, and even human intelligence. The Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was launched in 2006 as a truly commercial service open to everybody.

Google Apps (2009): In 2009, Google Apps entered the scene, offering cloud computing enterprise applications.

Microsoft Azure (2009): In the same year, Microsoft launched Windows Azure, marking its entry into the cloud computing space. Other major players like Oracle and HP also joined the evolution.

Mainstream Adoption: Today, cloud computing has become mainstream, with various companies, both early and late adopters, actively participating in the cloud computing ecosystem.
